# WASS
Web Attached Storage: a place to store all your stuff.  

[PM> Install-Package WASS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WASS/)  

## Intro

Like a NAS (*Network Attached Storage*), but with a web focus.  
The extra **S** in WAS**S**, is so the pronunciation is the same as NAS.  
WASS aims to be your backup, and access solution for your private files.
